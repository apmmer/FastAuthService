// Package base_repo provides functionality for performing basic operations on DB.
//
// This package contains functions for performing various general operations.
// All functions (and related utils) depends on abstract data, no concrete models included.
// The main reasons for creating this package are following the DRY method and simplifying
// the code, as well as the structure of the project.
// This module can be replaced, the database can be changed,
// but all the code outside of this module will remain intact.
